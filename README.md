***The answers are for the final project***
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
The final project was Creating code that will convert the TI board into a thermostat. the problem to be solved was to create code that would effectively report out the output of the internal temperature sensor, and also be able to turn on the setpoint for the temp via the buttons in the TI board. 
**What did you do particularly well?**
I think I did well the structure of the coding, and making sure it seemed organized.
**Where could you improve?**
there is a lot still im learning from the programing of embedded systems so I would say more training.
**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
Colleages and co-workers who understand these systems, for future growth.
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
the use of this new software for coding, and being able to have hardware programmed to do a function that could be nessecary. 
**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
maintining an organized document structure, with the right commentary and understandable code for further use and future upgrade.
